# RBAC Security Fix - Complete Summary

## 🚨 Critical Security Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Anonymous (unauthenticated) users could access user_profile data about employees by simply mentioning their name in a query.

**Example:** Anonymous user querying "What is Eden Levi's role?" would receive sensitive employee information.

**Security Impact:** HIGH - Privacy violation, unauthorized access to employee data.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated RBAC Logic in `queryProcessing.service.js`

**Previous (INSECURE) Logic:**
```javascript
const allowUserProfiles = isAdmin || hasSpecificUserName;
// ❌ This allowed ANY user (even anonymous) to access user profiles
```

**New (SECURE) Logic:**
```javascript
// 🔐 SECURE RBAC LOGIC
let allowUserProfiles = false;

if (isAdmin) {
  // Admins can see all user profiles
  allowUserProfiles = true;
  
} else if (isHR) {
  // HR can see all user profiles (required for employee management)
  allowUserProfiles = true;
  
} else if (isTrainer && hasSpecificUserName) {
  // Trainers can see specific user profiles when explicitly asked
  allowUserProfiles = true;
  
} else if (isManager && hasSpecificUserName) {
  // Managers can see specific user profiles when explicitly asked
  allowUserProfiles = true;
  
} else if (isEmployee && isQueryAboutOwnProfile) {
  // Employees can ONLY see their OWN profile
  allowUserProfiles = true;
  
} else {
  // Everyone else (anonymous, guest, unauthorized) - NO ACCESS
  allowUserProfiles = false;
}
```

## 🔍 Changes Made

### File: `BACKEND/src/services/queryProcessing.service.js`

1. **Added Authentication Check:**
   ```javascript
   const isAuthenticated = user_id && user_id !== 'anonymous' && user_id !== 'guest';
   ```

2. **Added Role-Based Authorization:**
   ```javascript
   const isAdmin = userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'administrator';
   const isHR = userRole === 'hr' || userRole === 'HR' || userRole === 'human_resources';
   const isTrainer = userRole === 'trainer' || userRole === 'TRAINER';
   const isManager = userRole === 'manager';
   const isEmployee = userRole === 'employee' || userRole === 'user';
   ```

3. **Added Own Profile Detection:**
   ```javascript
   const isQueryAboutOwnProfile = (() => {
     if (!isAuthenticated || !userProfile) return false;
     // Check if query mentions user's own name or "my role" / "my profile"
     ...
   })();
   ```

4. **Updated RBAC Logic (Main Search):**
   - Admin: Full access ✅
   - HR: Full access ✅ (required for employee management)
   - Trainer: Can see specific users when asked ✅
   - Manager: Can see specific users when asked ✅
   - Employee: Only own profile ✅
   - Anonymous: No access ❌

5. **Updated RBAC Logic (Low Threshold Fallback):**
   - Same secure logic applied to fallback search

6. **Added Security Logging:**
   ```javascript
   if (!allowUserProfiles && userProfilesFound.length > 0) {
     console.warn('🚨 SECURITY: Unauthorized access attempt blocked:', {
       userRole, userId, isAuthenticated, query, action: 'BLOCKED'
     });
   }
   ```

7. **Updated Error Messages:**
   - Anonymous users: "I found information but you need to log in to access employee information."
   - Authenticated users: "You don't have permission to access it. Your current role: {role}."

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Anonymous User (Should FAIL)
- **User:** `anonymous`
- **Query:** "What is Eden Levi's role?"
- **Expected:** ❌ BLOCKED - "I found information but you need to log in to access employee information."
- **Actual:** ✅ Should NOT show Eden Levi's details

### Test Case 2: Admin User (Should SUCCEED)
- **User:** `admin`
- **Query:** "What is Eden Levi's role?"
- **Expected:** ✅ ALLOWED - Full details about Eden Levi
- **Actual:** ✅ Should show "Engineering Manager..."

### Test Case 2b: HR User (Should SUCCEED)
- **User:** `hr` or `HR`
- **Query:** "What is Eden Levi's role?"
- **Expected:** ✅ ALLOWED - Full details about Eden Levi
- **Actual:** ✅ Should show employee information

### Test Case 2c: Trainer User (Should SUCCEED)
- **User:** `trainer` or `TRAINER`
- **Query:** "What is Eden Levi's role?"
- **Expected:** ✅ ALLOWED - Details about Eden Levi (if name mentioned)
- **Actual:** ✅ Should show employee information

### Test Case 3: Regular Employee Asking About Others (Should FAIL)
- **User:** `employee` (Noa Bar)

## 📋 Security Logging

### What Gets Logged

When unauthorized access is attempted:

```javascript
🚨 SECURITY: Unauthorized access attempt blocked: {
  userRole: 'anonymous',
  userId: 'anonymous',
  isAuthenticated: false,
  query: 'What is Eden Levi\'s role?',
  attemptedAccess: 'user_profile',
  userProfilesFound: 1,
  action: 'BLOCKED',
  reason: 'User not authenticated'
}
```

### Where to Check Logs

1. **Railway Logs:** Check for `🚨 SECURITY:` messages
2. **Application Logs:** Look for `logger.warn('🚨 SECURITY: ...')` entries
3. **Console Logs:** Check `console.warn('🚨 SECURITY: ...')` output

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After fixing RBAC:

- ✅ Anonymous users CANNOT access user_profile data
- ✅ Employees can ONLY see their own profile
- ✅ Managers can see specific user profiles when asked
- ✅ Admins can see all user profiles
- ✅ Clear error messages for unauthorized access
- ✅ Security logging for access attempts
- ✅ Both main search and fallback search use secure RBAC

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. **Test All Scenarios:** Run through all 5 test cases before deploying
2. **Monitor Logs:** Watch for security warnings after deployment
3. **Verify Anonymous Access:** Confirm anonymous users are blocked
4. **Check Employee Access:** Verify employees can only see own profile
5. **Monitor Manager Access:** Ensure managers can see specific users when asked

---

## 📝 Summary

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Anonymous users could access employee data
- ❌ Any user mentioning a name got access
- ❌ No authentication check
- ❌ Security vulnerability

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Anonymous users blocked completely
- ✅ Authentication required for user profiles
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced
- ✅ Security logging implemented
- ✅ Clear error messages for unauthorized access

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix**
2. **Test all 5 scenarios** (see Test Cases above)
3. **Monitor security logs** for access attempts
4. **Verify** that anonymous users are blocked
5. **Confirm** that employees can access only their own profile

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a **critical security fix** - deploy immediately
- The previous logic was **INSECURE** and allowed privacy violations
- All user_profile access now requires proper authentication and authorization
- Security logging helps detect and prevent future unauthorized access attempts
