- {{TIMESTAMP}} | {{AUTHOR}} | INIT | Global | Template system initialized
- 2025-01-27T14:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_05_Frontend | Implemented complete Frontend Chatbot UI Widget. Created modern floating chatbot with TailwindCSS (Dark Emerald theme), Framer Motion animations, 6 React components (ChatWidgetButton, ChatPanel, ChatHeader, ChatMessage, Recommendations, ChatInput), mock bot logic, dynamic recommendation system, responsive design. All components ready for backend integration. Feature F-0016 completed.
- 2025-01-27T15:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | ADD | Global | Created comprehensive FULLSTACK_TEMPLATES_METHODOLOGY_PROMPT.md documenting complete methodology, all 9 stages, feature lifecycle management, logging system, best practices, and usage instructions. Document serves as complete guide for building projects using the Full-Stack Templates system.
- 2025-01-27T15:30:00Z | Cursor Agent | ADD | Global | Created MASTER_PROMPT.md - executable prompt for Cursor AI to build projects using Full-Stack Templates. Contains stage-by-stage execution protocol, adaptive questioning rules, logging protocol, feature management, recovery procedures, and example interaction flows. Ready-to-use prompt for AI assistants.
- 2025-01-27T16:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | ADD | Global | Created RAG_PROJECT_COMPLETE_PROMPT.md - comprehensive project-specific prompt containing all 16 features (F-0001 to F-0016), complete technical specifications, API endpoints, data model, system flows, frontend architecture, implementation status, and all project-specific details. Serves as complete reference for RAG microservice project.
- 2025-01-27T17:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_05_Frontend | Implemented Chatbot Proxy Assistant Behavior (F-0017). Support Mode (Assessment/DevLab) now acts as transparent proxy: forwards user messages to microservices verbatim, returns microservice responses without modification or commentary. Created microserviceProxy service with metadata tracking (timestamp, session_id, support_mode). Updated FloatingChatWidget to route Support Mode messages through proxy while General Mode uses intelligent chatbot responses. No general chat, small talk, or intelligent responses in Support Mode. Stay in Support Mode until explicit exit command.
- 2025-01-27T18:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_08_Backend | Implemented REST API endpoints for chatbot. Created /api/v1/query endpoint with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration for General Chat Mode. Added proxy endpoints /api/assessment/support and /api/devlab/support for Support Mode. Implemented Query Processing Service with OpenAI embeddings and answer generation. Added recommendations endpoint /api/v1/personalized/recommendations/:userId. Created controllers and routes. Added CORS middleware, request validation, error handling. Backend now fully supports frontend chatbot with OpenAI integration.
- 2025-01-27T18:30:00Z | Cursor Agent | FIX | Stage_08_Backend | Fixed Redis to be truly optional. Updated redis.config.js with lazy connection, retry limits (stops after 3 attempts), and silent error handling. Added REDIS_ENABLED environment variable. Updated queryProcessing.service.js to gracefully handle Redis unavailability. Created REDIS_EXPLANATION.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md guides. Service now works perfectly without Redis (no connection spam, no errors). Redis is optional for caching - service works without it, just slower responses.
