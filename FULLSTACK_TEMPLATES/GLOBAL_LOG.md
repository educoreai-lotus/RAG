- {{TIMESTAMP}} | {{AUTHOR}} | INIT | Global | Template system initialized
- 2025-01-27T14:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_05_Frontend | Implemented complete Frontend Chatbot UI Widget. Created modern floating chatbot with TailwindCSS (Dark Emerald theme), Framer Motion animations, 6 React components (ChatWidgetButton, ChatPanel, ChatHeader, ChatMessage, Recommendations, ChatInput), mock bot logic, dynamic recommendation system, responsive design. All components ready for backend integration. Feature F-0016 completed.
- 2025-01-27T15:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | ADD | Global | Created comprehensive FULLSTACK_TEMPLATES_METHODOLOGY_PROMPT.md documenting complete methodology, all 9 stages, feature lifecycle management, logging system, best practices, and usage instructions. Document serves as complete guide for building projects using the Full-Stack Templates system.
- 2025-01-27T15:30:00Z | Cursor Agent | ADD | Global | Created MASTER_PROMPT.md - executable prompt for Cursor AI to build projects using Full-Stack Templates. Contains stage-by-stage execution protocol, adaptive questioning rules, logging protocol, feature management, recovery procedures, and example interaction flows. Ready-to-use prompt for AI assistants.
- 2025-01-27T16:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | ADD | Global | Created RAG_PROJECT_COMPLETE_PROMPT.md - comprehensive project-specific prompt containing all 16 features (F-0001 to F-0016), complete technical specifications, API endpoints, data model, system flows, frontend architecture, implementation status, and all project-specific details. Serves as complete reference for RAG microservice project.
- 2025-01-27T17:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_05_Frontend | Implemented Chatbot Proxy Assistant Behavior (F-0017). Support Mode (Assessment/DevLab) now acts as transparent proxy: forwards user messages to microservices verbatim, returns microservice responses without modification or commentary. Created microserviceProxy service with metadata tracking (timestamp, session_id, support_mode). Updated FloatingChatWidget to route Support Mode messages through proxy while General Mode uses intelligent chatbot responses. No general chat, small talk, or intelligent responses in Support Mode. Stay in Support Mode until explicit exit command.
- 2025-01-27T18:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_08_Backend | Implemented REST API endpoints for chatbot. Created /api/v1/query endpoint with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration for General Chat Mode. Added proxy endpoints /api/assessment/support and /api/devlab/support for Support Mode. Implemented Query Processing Service with OpenAI embeddings and answer generation. Added recommendations endpoint /api/v1/personalized/recommendations/:userId. Created controllers and routes. Added CORS middleware, request validation, error handling. Backend now fully supports frontend chatbot with OpenAI integration.

 - 2025-11-16T00:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_08_Backend | Hardened Support Mode: added explicit gating via env and route middleware, removed keyword-based auto-switch on frontend, added routing decision logs and pretty logging option. Enabled strict RAG with gRPC fallback hook and dynamic no-data messaging. Cleaned general-mode UX by removing the "Contact Support" quick-action button. Added in-chat EDUCORE quickstart when selecting "Get Started Guide".
- 2025-01-27T20:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | COMPLETE | Stage_08_Backend | Connected Recommendations to Backend API. Created recommendations.service.js with personalized recommendations generation based on user profile (skill gaps, role), query history, popular content, and mode (General/Assessment/DevLab). Updated recommendations.controller.js to use service with query params support (tenant_id, mode, limit). Updated queryProcessing.service.js to generate and save recommendations after query processing. Updated FloatingChatWidget.jsx to use useGetRecommendationsQuery hook with API integration, fallback to client-side recommendations. Updated ragApi.js to support query params. Recommendations now fully integrated: Backend generates personalized recommendations, Frontend displays them, recommendations saved to database. Feature F-0009 and F-0020 completed.
- 2025-01-27T20:30:00Z | Cursor Agent | FIX | Stage_05_Frontend | Fixed Recommendations not showing in production deployment. Fixed RTK Query API call - changed query function signature from (userId, options) to ({ userId, tenant_id, mode, limit }). Fixed useGetRecommendationsQuery hook call to use single object parameter. Improved fallback logic: added anonymous user handling (always use client-side), added error handling, added useEffect to update recommendations when API data arrives, added console.log for debugging. Recommendations now work correctly in production with proper fallback. Files: FRONTEND/src/store/api/ragApi.js, FRONTEND/src/components/chat/FloatingChatWidget/FloatingChatWidget.jsx, RECOMMENDATIONS_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md.
- 2025-01-27T18:30:00Z | Cursor Agent | FIX | Stage_08_Backend | Fixed Redis to be truly optional. Updated redis.config.js with lazy connection, retry limits (stops after 3 attempts), and silent error handling. Added REDIS_ENABLED environment variable. Updated queryProcessing.service.js to gracefully handle Redis unavailability. Created REDIS_EXPLANATION.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md guides. Service now works perfectly without Redis (no connection spam, no errors). Redis is optional for caching - service works without it, just slower responses.
- 2025-01-27T19:00:00Z | Cursor Agent | FIX | Stage_08_Backend | Fixed CORS configuration to support multiple origins. Updated CORS middleware to support localhost for development and Vercel production URLs via FRONTEND_VERCEL_URL environment variable. Implemented dynamic origin checking with logging. Added CORS_SETUP.md and CORS_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md guides. Backend now supports both local development and Vercel production deployments without CORS errors.
