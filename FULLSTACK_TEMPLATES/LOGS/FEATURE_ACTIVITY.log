2025-01-27T14:00:00Z | FRONTEND | Implemented complete Chatbot UI Widget with TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and React. Created 6 components: ChatWidgetButton (floating bubble), ChatPanel (main container), ChatHeader (greeting + status), ChatMessage (bot/user messages), Recommendations (dynamic suggestions), ChatInput (search bar). Features: Dark Emerald theme, smooth animations, responsive design, mock bot logic, recommendation system with quick actions and cards
2025-01-27T17:00:00Z | FRONTEND | Implemented Proxy Assistant Behavior for Support Mode. Created microserviceProxy service for transparent relay between user and microservices (Assessment/DevLab). Support Mode now acts as proxy: forwards messages verbatim to microservices, returns responses without modification or commentary. Includes metadata (timestamp, session_id, support_mode, user_id, tenant_id). Updated FloatingChatWidget to use proxy behavior in Support Mode while General Mode continues using intelligent responses. Feature F-0017 completed.
2025-01-27T18:00:00Z | BACKEND | Implemented REST API endpoints for chatbot. Created /api/v1/query endpoint for General Chat Mode with OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration. Added proxy endpoints /api/assessment/support and /api/devlab/support for Support Mode. Implemented Query Processing Service with OpenAI embeddings and answer generation. Added recommendations endpoint /api/v1/personalized/recommendations/:userId. Created Query Controller, Microservice Support Controller, and Recommendations Controller. Added CORS middleware, request validation, and error handling. Backend now fully supports frontend chatbot with OpenAI integration.
2025-01-27T18:30:00Z | BACKEND | Fixed Redis to be truly optional. Updated redis.config.js with lazy connection, retry limits, and silent error handling. Redis now stops retrying after 3 attempts to avoid spam. Added REDIS_ENABLED environment variable to completely disable Redis. Updated queryProcessing.service.js to gracefully handle Redis unavailability. Created REDIS_EXPLANATION.md with comprehensive guide on Redis usage, caching benefits, and troubleshooting. Service now works perfectly without Redis (just slower responses without cache).
